hi test

1. how to download. should ideally explain differences between stable and dev builds
2. discord server for help?
3. anything else?

should probably have some images of the UI and explain what each thing does. Could name it "graphical user interface" and be part of a different page. maybe explain each individual element in the left list and how to navigate it? Would also be helpful to link to GMS documentation.
Maybe seperate pages for "common operations" like editing code, adding sprites, audio etc.?
